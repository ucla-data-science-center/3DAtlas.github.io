                        The University of California (UC) Libraries 3D Scanning Atlas is a collaboration among
                        librarians and library staff at UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles, UC San
                        Francisco, and UC Berkeley. All participating libraries are part of the University of California
                        3D Data Common Knowledge Group (CKG). The goal of the atlas is to create a collection of 3D
                        scanned reference objects using different 3D scanning technologies available at UC Libraries.
                        <br> <br>
                        The 3D Scanning Atlas provides qualitative, quantitative, and visual information to effectively
                        evaluate how the 3D scanners available across the UC Library system interact with different
                        types of materials and how they compare to one another. The objects chosen for 3D scanning
                        represent various material properties important in the 3D scanning process. We hope the 3D
                        Scanning Atlas enables campus constituents to make informed decisions about which 3D scanning
                        option best fits their education and research needs and provides librarians and library staff
                        with data to make informed purchases.

                        3D scanning technologies available at UC Libraries. We use the term “atlas” here not to imply
                        geospatial information, but in its broader definition as a bound collection of tables,
                        illustrations etc. on any given subject.

            <h3 class="descriptionhead">3D Scanners</h3>
            The 3D Data Atlas includes a range of 3D scanners currently available across UC Libraries.
            The following
            criteria were identified for comparing the 3D scanners: resolution; ability to capture
            transparency/semi-transparency, cavities, and reflectivity; time to 3D scan; and price.
            <br>
            <br>The following 3D scanners and digital cameras were used to use scan the objects at the
            respective libraries:
            <ul>
                <li>Artec Space Spider (UCLA)</li>
                <li>Canon 6D (UCSC)</li>
                <li>Einscan-SE (UCR)</li>
                <li>Einscan-SP (UCSF)</li>
                <li>Einscan Pro (UCB)</li>
                <li>Einscan Pro 2X with HD attachment (UCSC)</li>
                <li>Einscan Pro 2X with Color attachment (UCSC)</li>
                <li>iPhone 13 (UCSF, UCSD, UCLA, UCSC)</li>

            <h3 class="descriptionhead">Scanning Process</h3>
            The 3D CKG members have a range of experience using 3D scanning technology. 3D CKG
            members agreed on the
            following process that would be beneficial for both novice and experts:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the 3D scanner manufacturer’s software to 3D scan whenever possible
                </li>
                <li> Use default settings in 3D scanning software whenever possible
                </li>
                <li>Follow manufacturer documentation rather than bringing in any personal knowledge
                    about scanning
                </li>
                <li> Use only lighting from environment and avoid using additional lighting
                </li>
                <li> Time how long it takes to complete the 3D scanning process from start to finish
                </li>
                <li> Export as both OBJ and STL whenever possible
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The 3D CKG members acknowledge that there are a number of ways to improve the outcome of
            3D scans (e.g., using
            additional lighting, powder coating, etc). We intentionally did not apply previous 3D
            scanning knowledge or
            techniques. Rather, we simply followed the manufacturers’ instructions. The intention is
            to produce 3D models
            for the Atlas that someone with minimal 3D scanning experience could expect.

            <h3 class="descriptionhead">Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Inexpensive 3D scanners can produce usable scans based on the characteristics of the object
                    being scanned.
                </li>
                <li>High-power, expensive 3D scanners tend to consistently produce better results.
                </li>
                <li>University of California 3D Data Common Knowledge Group learned of the 3D scanning capabilities
                    across
                    UC Libraries. This can be helpful for collaboration and research within the UC Library system.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            We hope the 3D Scanning Atlas enables campus constituents to make informed decisions about which 3D
            scanning option best fits their education and research needs and provides librarians and library staff
            with data to make informed purchases.
