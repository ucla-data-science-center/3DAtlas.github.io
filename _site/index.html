            <p>
                The University of California (UC) Libraries 3D Scanning Data Atlas is a collaboration among librarians
                and
                library
                staff at UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles, UC San Francisco, and UC Berkeley. All
                participating
                libraries are part of the University of California 3D Data Common Knowledge Group (CKG). The goal of the
                atlas is to
                create a collection of 3D scanned reference objects using different 3D scanning technologies available
                at UC
                Libraries.
                <br> <br>
                The 3D Scanning Data Atlas provides qualitative, quantitative, and visual information to effectively
                evaluate
                how the 3D scanners available across the UC Library system interact with different types of materials
                and
                how they
                compare to one another. The objects chosen for 3D scanning represent various material properties
                important
                in the 3D
                scanning process. We hope the 3D Scanning Data Atlas enables campus constituents to make informed
                decisions
                about
                which 3D scanning option best fits their education and research needs and provides librarians and
                library
                staff with
                data to make informed purchases.
            </p>

            <h3 class="descriptionhead">Objects 3D Scanned</h3>
            <p>
                We chose seven objects based on the following requirements: low-cost; easily accessible and relatively
                future-proof for reproduction; represent different sizes, materials, interior structures, and
                reflectivity.
                <br>
                <br>
                The following objects were purchased and shipped to five of the participating UC Libraries:
                <br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Nut bolt thread gauge for capturing measurement accuracy</td>
                    <td><img class="objref" src="resources/gauge.jpg"> </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Stainless steel hex head screw for capturing measurement accuracy and shine</td>
                    <td> <img class="objref" src="resources/mcmasternut.jpg"> </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Human skull model for capturing cavities and crevices</td>
                    <td> <img class="objref" src="resources/skull.jpg"> </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Fuzzy dice for capturing fuzzy texture</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Chess piece for capturing frosted glass</td>
                    <td> <img class="objref" src="resources/frostedknight.jpg"> </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </table>

            Funding for the 3D Scanning Data Atlas project was provided through a Librarians Association of the

            <h3 class="descriptionhead">3D Scanners</h3>
            The 3D Data Atlas includes a range of 3D scanners currently available across UC Libraries.
            The following
            criteria were identified for comparing the 3D scanners: resolution; ability to capture
            transparency/semi-transparency, cavities, and reflectivity; time to 3D scan; and price.

            <br>The following 3D scanners and digital cameras were used to use scan the objects at the
            respective libraries:
            <ul>
                <li>Artec Space Spider (UCLA)</li>
                <li>Canon 6D (UCSC)</li>
                <li>Einscan-SE (UCR)</li>
                <li>Einscan-SP (UCSF)</li>
                <li>Einscan Pro (UCB)</li>
                <li>Einscan Pro 2X with HD attachment (UCSC)</li>
                <li>Einscan Pro 2X with Color attachment (UCSC)</li>
                <li>iPhone 13 (UCSF, UCSD, UCLA, UCSC)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="descriptionhead">3D Scanning Process</h3>
            The 3D CKG members have a range of experience using 3D scanning technology. 3D CKG
            members agreed on the
            following process that would be beneficial for both novice and experts:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the 3D scanner manufacturer’s software to 3D scan whenever possible
                </li>
                <li> Use default settings in 3D scanning software whenever possible
                </li>
                <li>Follow manufacturer documentation rather than bringing in any personal knowledge
                    about scanning
                </li>
                <li> Use only lighting from environment and avoid using additional lighting
                </li>
                <li> Time how long it takes to complete the 3D scanning process from start to finish
                </li>
                <li> Export as both OBJ and STL whenever possible
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The 3D CKG members acknowledge that there are a number of ways to improve the outcome of
            3D scans (e.g., using
            additional lighting, powder coating, etc). We intentionally did not apply previous 3D
            scanning knowledge or
            techniques. Rather, we simply followed the manufacturers’ instructions. The intention is
            to produce 3D models
            for the Atlas that someone with minimal 3D scanning experience could expect.

            <h3 class="descriptionhead">Comparison of 3D Scanners by object</h3>
            The 3D Scanning Data Atlas is powered by the Potree Viewer and is hosted by
            UCLA. See the figure below for
            instructions on using the viewer.

            <h3 class="descriptionhead">Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Inexpensive 3D scanners can produce usable scans based on the characteristics of the object
                    being scanned.
                </li>
                <li>High-power, expensive 3D scanners tend to consistently produce better results.
                </li>
                <li>University of California 3D Data Common Knowledge Group learned of the 3D scanning capabilities
                    across
                    UC Libraries. This can be helpful for collaboration and research within the UC Library system.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            We hope the 3D Scanning Data Atlas enables campus constituents to make informed decisions about which 3D
            scanning option best fits their education and research needs and provides librarians and library staff
            with data to make informed purchases.
            <br>
            <br>
            We want to emphasize that this Atlas was designed so that other institutions can contribute their scanning
            methods to the Atlas. To do so, they should contact Doug Daniels at <a
